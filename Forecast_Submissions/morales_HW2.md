## Rationale:
It was helpful to be able to isolate the last few weeks of data and have them immediately populate a graph. I am a little frustrated that it's not as easy as selecting mm/dd, instead I have to count how many days I want to go back and then subtract that amount from 11,931 to set as my range. Nevertheless, very cool!

I can't believe there are dates on the plot that experienced almost 60,000cfs of flow; it appears to have happened sometime around 1990. It's interesting to see that in the past 30 years, there has been a decline in the amount of massive flow events. Although it seems to be rebounding from a "low" around 2009.

## Grade:
3/3 Great job! Don't worry we will be able to grab things by the actual dates soon. I'm glad you found it cool anyway :)
