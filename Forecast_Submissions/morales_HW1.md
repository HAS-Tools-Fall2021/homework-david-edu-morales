## Rationale:
After pulling the data from the USGS website, I manipulated the data using a PivtoTable on Excel so that I could more easily look at stream flows from August/September dates. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to restrict the dates shown to just the weeks we were currently forecasting; but it was helpful in looking at what was past stream flows had been.
