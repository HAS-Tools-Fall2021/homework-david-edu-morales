# Team Xueyan, Kevin, and David (XKD), HW12, 11/14/21

## Rationale:
1. Streamflow forecast:
   - One-week forecast: 139 cfs
   - Two-week forecast: 89 cfs
  
2. The team met in class to determine what features would be included in the forecast code. Xueyan created the linear regression model and generated a graph to display observed flow and precipitation since 2000. David downloaded the netCDF data using the lat/lon boundaries for the HUC4 1506 watershed. These data were used in the linear regression model which was then converted into a function to facilitate streamflow forecast.
