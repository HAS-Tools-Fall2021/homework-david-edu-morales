Use this folder to submit your cheat sheets for grading

#Grades:
1. GitHub take 1: 5/10 Great start. Content wise you have what you need here but this looks like just a picture of your in-class notes. I would like so see you pull together what you have into a single page summary of just the GitHub concepts that will be easy to refer back to.  Don't worry about the indexing etc we will cover those in later cheat sheets.
1.b GitHub Resubmission: 10/10 Great work! I like your approach.
