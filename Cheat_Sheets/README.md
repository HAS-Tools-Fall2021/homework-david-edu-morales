#Grades:
1. GitHub: 5/10 Great start. Content wise you have what you need here but this looks like just a picture of your in-class notes. I would like so see you pull together what you have into a single page summary of just the GitHub concepts that will be easy to refer back to.  Don't worry about the indexing etc we will cover those in later cheat sheets.
