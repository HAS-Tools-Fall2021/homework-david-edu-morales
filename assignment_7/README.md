# Instructions for HW7 Partner Assignment:

## Intro:
Hello. I tried to make the script and these instructions as straightfoward as I could; honestly, it's as simple as running each cell sequentially. I wasn't sure what I was supposed to set up for you, nor did I understand if--and to what degree--you were supposed to interact with the code. 

Enjoy!

## Summary:
This script begins with:
- Package Import
  
Which is followed by:
- Filepath creation
- Data read-in
- Datetime parsing for ease-of-use

Then, I establish four (4) functions:
- historical_flow() : finds historical mean flow of set timeframe
- add_dQ_df() : calculates and adds change in flow (dQ)
- flow_analysis() : generates plots of mean flows & dQ
- week_stat() : generates and prints stats of mean flow dataframes

Finally, the script that creates the objects you will interact with via the above created functions. *Again, you simply need to run each cell in order, that's it.*

**Note: My weekly forecasts are found at the bottom of the print output from line252-258**

I hope this helps.

Take care,

David
