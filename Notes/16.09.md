# Class Notes, Sept. 16
## Numpy Arrays:
Numpy is a package and packages are typically utilized in py script as follows:
- import numpy as np (where "np" is shorthand for easy reference)

Packages incorporate various capabilities described below (*what follows are examples of interacting with a list*):
  - Functions: something to execute an action
    - package.function_name(arg1)
    - np.min(myarray)

- Attributes: returns properties to an object
  - object.attribute
  - myarray.len

- Methods: actions associated with an object
  - object.method(arg1...argn)
  - myarray.reshape(x)

Numpy array is an object that stores a grid of numbers;
    different than lists: must be all the same data type (*float* or *int*)

### Numpy Array example:

    Array1 = np.array([1,2,3]) <-1D array
    Array2 = np.array([1,2,3], [4,5,6]) <-2D array
    Array3 = np.ones((dim1, dim2)) *row, column*
        Array3 = np.ones((3,6))
    Array4 = np.zeroes((dim1, dim2))
    
    Other functions include:
        np.arange(start, stop, shape)
        np.reshape(array, (dim1, dim2))

np.arange(start, stop, shape)

np.reshape <- changes *shape* of an object
- Example: np.reshape(test, (2,3))

### Attributes:
    Ex. 1
    | 1 2 4 |
    | 6 2 8 |
    | 3 1 6 |
myarray.shape => size in every dimension, *(3,3)*

myarray.ndim => # of dimensions, *2*

myarray.size => total # of elements, *9*

myarray.dtaype => data type

### Indexing:
(Start:Stop:Step), same convention as lists
- with the exception of *repeat for every dimension* with ',' in between; formatted by [row, column]
  
        Ex. 2 w/ indexing
        | 1 2 4 | 0
        | 6 2 8 | 1
        | 3 1 6 | 2
          0 1 2

To retrieve first column: myarray[ : , 0 ]

To retrieve first row: [ 1, : ]

        To retrieve the middle block of:        
        | 1 2 4 5 |
        | 6 2 8 10|
        | 3 1 6 11|

        myarray[:2, 1:3]
